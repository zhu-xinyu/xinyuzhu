I am currently a year 3 PhD student at Newcastle University in the UK, specializing in generative syntax. My doctoral research mainly addresses syntactic issues related to adverbs under the framework of minimalist syntax. Besides, I have a personal interest in syntactic research on Wu Chinese as well.

My educational journey has been quite unconventional. I attended a secondary vocational school in high school, where I majored in Business English. Later, I was admitted to a vocational college (Zhejiang Financial College) with the same major for my undergraduate studies. After three years, I took the standardized college transfer exam and was accepted into a bachelor's program in English at China Jiliang University, where I studied for two years. Upon completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued a master's degree at the University of Leeds in the UK. After graduating, I spent six months studying Japanese at a language school in Kyoto, Japan, as part of my gap year plan. Finally, I arrived at Newcastle University in the UK to pursue my PhD.

Research Interests
======
* Adverb syntax; Chinese dialects syntax (esp. Wu Chinese)
* Generative Syntax: Minimalist Program; Distributed Morphology
* Syntax-Prosody Interface: Contiguity Theory
* Natural Language Processing (Python)
* And all sorts of interesting language phenomena

I am also passionate about writing popular science articles on linguistics, and providing online tutorials and Q&A sessions in generative syntax. Below are some related websites and videos.
