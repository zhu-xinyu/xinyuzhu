I am currently a PhD student at **Newcastle University** in the UK, specializing in **generative syntax**. My doctoral research mainly addresses syntactic issues related to adverbs. I am particularly interested in Distributed Morphology and cartographic syntax. Besides, I have a personal interest in syntactic research on Wu Chinese as well.

My educational journey has been quite unconventional. I attended a secondary vocational school in high school, where I majored in Business English. Later, I was admitted to Zhejiang Financial College with the same major for my undergraduate studies. After three years, I took the standardized college transfer exam (专升本) and was accepted into a bachelor's program in English at China Jiliang University, where I studied for two years. Upon completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued a master's degree at the University of Leeds in the UK. After graduating, I spent six months studying Japanese at a language school in Kyoto, Japan, as part of my gap year plan. Finally, I arrived at Newcastle University in the UK to pursue my PhD.
