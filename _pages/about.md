I am currently a PhD student at Newcastle University in the UK, specializing in generative syntax. My doctoral research mainly addresses syntactic issues related to adverbs. I am particularly interested in Distributed Morphology and cartographic syntax. Besides, I have a personal interest in syntactic research on Wu Chinese as well.
