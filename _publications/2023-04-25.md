Based on the VP-shell hypothesis under the framework of Generative Grammar, this paper present a brief investigation on the syntactic nature of the strictly VP adverb ‘Kuai (soon)’ in the structure of ‘Verb-Kuai’ in Shaoxing Wu Chinese. Different from the methodologies and frameworks of the previous traditional research on Chinese dialects, the paper implements the concepts and hypotheses under the Generative Grammar framework to the study of Chinese dialects for the first time, which could be seen as an enlightenment for the syntactic research of Chinese dialects.
