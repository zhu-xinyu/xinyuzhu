The critical period has long been an important research topic in second language acquisition even in the whole field of language acquisition. It is worth further investigating whether the factor of age will uniformly affect every module and phenomenon in the process of second language acquisition or whether every level of language acquisition has its own critical period effect. Under the framework of Principles and Parameters, this article focuses on the influence of the critical period on the syntactic level of second language acquisition. Taking the functional module like morphosyntax and the lexical module like negation at the syntactic level as the research objects, this paper demonstrates the differential effect of the critical period in the process of second language acquisition,through the discussion of previous experiments and the theoretical analysis of the syntactic theories.Then, this article concludes that second language learners have a strong critical period effect during the acquisition of syntactic functional modules, while the critical period effect is weak in the acquisition of lexical modules such as negation.
