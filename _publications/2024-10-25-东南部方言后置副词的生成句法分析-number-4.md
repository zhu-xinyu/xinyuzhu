In Mandarin, certain adverbs typically precede the verb, whereas in southeastern dialects such as Wu and Cantonese, they are postverbal. Although earlier studies have explored this phenomenon from perspectives of traditional grammar, linguistic typology, semantics, and pragmatics, a systematic analysis using generative syntax has been relatively lacking. The VP-shell hypothesis in generative syntax provides a new theoretical perspective, enabling a systematic elucidation of the syntactic mechanisms underlying the post-positioning of adverbs in dialects and their differences from the preverbal adverbs in Mandarin. According to this theory, postverbal adverbs in dialects can be seen as strictly VP adverbs with a fixed syntactic position within the VP layer; conversely, preverbal adverbs in Mandarin appear as strictly vP adverbs located in the higher vP layer. This distinction not only clarifies the distributional characteristics of adverbs across different Chinese variants but also offers a generative syntactic framework for understanding variations in word order, thereby enriching the grammatical theory’s descriptive and predictive capabilities regarding actual language use.
