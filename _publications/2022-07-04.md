This article focuses on the theoretical concepts of sentence derivation under the framework of Generative Grammar, and briefly describes the theoretical differences under this framework from the 1950s to the beginning of this century. This article makes a detailed introduction and evaluation of the Government & Binding theory and the syntactic derivation operation under the framework of the minimalist program. The article holds that in the continuous updating of the Generative Grammar, the theories that play a considerable role in explaining sentence generation mainly include the Theta theory and the concept of feature checking.
