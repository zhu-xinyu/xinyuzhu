The Shaoxing dialect of Wu Chinese employs a shared marker, bəʔ5, in both passive and disposal constructions. This marker also serves as a lexical verb meaning ‘to give’. This paper provides a description of the usage of bəʔ5 and proposes its syntactic derivation mechanism within the framework of Distributed Morphology. We argue that bəʔ5, appearing across different structures, is a unified phonological realization of the root √bəʔ5. During syntactic derivation, √bəʔ5 carries an underspecified root feature and merges with abstract morphemes, such as pass (passive), disp (disposal), and the categorial morpheme v, to receive specific feature assignments. In passive and disposal constructions, √bəʔ5 merges with pass/disp, functioning as the head of the VoiceP and serving as a shared marker. In the give-construction, √bəʔ5 merges with v, becoming the head of vP and acting as a lexical verb. Once assigned specific features, √bəʔ5 undergoes late insertion at the morphological-phonological interface, ultimately being realized as the phonological form /bəʔ5/.
